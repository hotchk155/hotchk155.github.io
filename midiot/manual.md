MIDIOT CHORD PROGRESSION is designed as a songwriting tool, a little box you can pick up when you need inspiration, or just can't figure what chord should go _there_

However its usefulness does not end there... MIDIOT 

- A chord calculator
- A chord based MIDI controller 
- A midi chord sequencer

See, despite the name, MIDIOT isn't dumb!


While it is fundamentally intended as a songwriting tool, MIDIOT can be used in a performance or recording setup as a chord sequencer, which can be coupled up nicely to an arpeggiator.

MIDIOT can generate an internal MIDI beat clock, which is sent to the MIDI output. It can also slave to a MIDI clock source connected to the MIDI input.






Basic Features

MIDIOT knows the basic rules of chord progressions. For example when you are playing in the key of C major, MIDIOT knows that the D chord is played as a minor.
Likewise 


MIDIOT has three basic keyboard layouts

- **Key** mode allows you to set any major or minor key and then have the correct chord type played for each root note you press on the keyboard. For example in the key of C major, the D chord is played as a minor. In the key of G minor, the B chord is played as a diminished type. 

- **Chord Family** mode again takes your selected musical key and maps the chord buttons accordingly. However in Chord Family mode the keys are transposed so that the root chord of the keyis always in the position of the C key. The labels below the white notes indicate which of the key chords is played on each note. By convention these are numbered in roman numerals. 

- **Free** mode does not have any associated musical key. Every note button plays a major chord rooted on the corresponding note.

While each layout mode defines a default chord for each note button, you are always free to override the chord type by pressing one of the nine chord buttons, and change the structure of the chord using one of the inversion buttons.



MIDIOT is all about chord progressions, and one of its key features is the chord progression "buffer". This is intended as a quick and convenient way to experiment with sequences of chords and the timing of changes between them. These chord progressions can be looped for playback on an attached MIDI instrument.

A chord progression can be saved to one of MIDIOT's memory slots. Stored  chord progressions can be chained together and played. Again MIDIOT is designed to make it quick and easy to experiment with song structure.

The finalised song structure can be saved as standard MIDI notes to an external MIDI sequencer or DAW. MIDIOT also allows for the saving and reloading of information using MIDI System Exclusive messages. Using an appropriate SysEx Librarian program you can save and backup your MIDIOT compositions on an external computer.

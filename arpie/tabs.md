# Tabs

Tabs are small expansion boards that plug into ARPIE's hack header. The idea is to provide reference designs that you can build on in your own way, but we might also offer them for sale depending on demand.

Two tabs are currently being developed

* <a href="../synchtab/index.html">synctab</a> is designed to allow ARPIE to both receive and send pulse clock signals, so it can synchronise with other devices that use voltage pulses for timing. In particular we're working with the Korg Volca series of synth/sequencer modules.

* <a href="../controltab/index.html">controltab</a> is a simple module mounting three potentiometers and a switch. You can use ARPIE's menus to configure the parameter that each of these will control (e.g. tempo, velocity, mod wheel, pitch bend)

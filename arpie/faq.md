# ARPIE FAQs

**Q: How do I get at the battery to change it?**<br>
A: You only need to remove the 4 screws holding the top PCB to the pillars. The connector can simply be pulled out of its socket allowing access to the battery holder (If connector is stiff just waggle it gently). Just take care to insert the connector pins in the correct holes when re-assembling it. Don't de-solder anything!!
